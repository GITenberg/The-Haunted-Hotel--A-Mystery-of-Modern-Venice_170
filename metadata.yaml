description: Is there no explanation of the mystery of The Haunted Hotel? Is The Haunted
  Hotel the tale of a haunting -- or the tale of a crime? The ghost of Lord Montberry
  haunts the Palace Hotel in Venice -- or does it? Montberry's beautiful-yet-terrifying
  wife, the Countess Narona, and her erstwhile brother are the center of the terror
  that fills the Palace Hotel. Are their malefactions at the root of the haunting
  -- or is there something darker, something much more unknowable at work?
